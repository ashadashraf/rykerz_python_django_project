# rykerz_python_django_project

I spearheaded the development of an e-commerce platform tailored to address the challenges of traditional meat shopping, where time constraints and transportation limitations often pose difficulties. This platform offers a convenient solution for users to order chicken and beef products directly from their homes or any location. The project follows a robust Django Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture with some JavaScript components. The backend code is characterized by its cleanliness and efficiency, ensuring smooth operation throughout the system.

* THIS ENTIRE PROJECT IS COMPLETELY BUILD FROM THE SCRATCH *
